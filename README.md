🏎️ F1 AI Assistant (RAG-based Formula 1 QA System) An AI-powered Formula 1 assistant built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This project allows users to ask natural language questions about F1 race data and receive accurate answers sourced directly from a structured dataset.

🚀 Features 📊 Query F1 race data using natural language 🤖 RAG architecture (Vector DB + LLM) ⚡ Fast semantic search with embeddings 🎨 Custom F1-themed animated UI 📈 Accuracy evaluation included 🧠 Works fully offline after indexing 🧠 Tech Stack Python LangChain ChromaDB (Vector Database) OpenAI / Local LLM Pandas HTML + CSS (Animated UI) 📂 Dataset Format: CSV

Example fields:

Race Name Date Winner Team Fastest Lap Points Grid Position Example file path:

d:\races.csv ⚙️ How It Works Load F1 dataset (CSV) Convert rows into text documents Generate embeddings Store in Chroma vector DB User asks question Relevant context retrieved LLM generates grounded answer 🎨 UI Features 🏁 Racing theme 🚗 Animated F1 car 🏴 Waving checkered flag Smooth transitions Dark racing UI 🧪 Accuracy Testing Manual evaluation using dataset-grounded questions.

Sample Questions Who won the Australia race? Who finished second? What was the fastest lap? How many laps were completed? Which team won? 📊 Accuracy Results Metric Score Correct Answers 9.5 / 10 Accuracy 95% Observations Strong on direct factual queries Weak on missing dataset fields No hallucinations detected 📄 Project Report A full evaluation report is included:
